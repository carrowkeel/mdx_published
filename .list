We apply these four approaches to three examples of species interactions in spatially distributed populations and compare their predictions. Each represents different assumptions about the biology and hence a comparison among them has biological as well as modeling implications. In the first case all four approaches agree, in the second the spatial models disagree with the nonspatial ones, while in the third the stochastic models with discrete individuals disagree with the ones based on differential equations. We show further that the limiting reaction-diffusion equations associated with particle systems can have different qualitative behavior from those obtained by simply adding diffusion terms to mean field equations.","framework":"js","model_id":"39NAhc"},{"lastUpdated":1703974298225,"title":"Gene drive spread in different population structures - two populations","authors":"Jaehee Kim, Keith D.

Given that a gene drive can potentially spill over to other populations or even other species, control measures and fail-safes strategies must be considered. Gene drives are designed to generate a rapid demographic decline, while at the same time generating a dynamic change in the population's genetics. Since these evolutionary and demographic processes are linked and are expected to occur at a similar time-scale during gene drive spread, feedback between these processes may significantly affect the outcome of deployment. To study this feedback and to understand how it affects gene drive spillovers, we developed a gene drive model that combines evolutionary and demographic dynamics in a two-population setting. The model demonstrates how feedback between evolutionary and demographic dynamics can generate additional outcomes to those generated by the evolutionary dynamics alone. We identify an outcome of particular interest, where the short-term suppression of the target population is followed by gene swamping and loss of the gene drive. This outcome could be useful for designing gene drive deployments that temporarily suppress the population, but ultimately do not remain in the population. Using our model, we demonstrate the robustness of this outcome to spillover and to the evolution of resistance, and suggest that it could be used as a fail-safe strategy for gene drive deployment.","framework":"py","model_id":"FPDRyL"},{"lastUpdated":1647854342867,"title":"A model of purging dynamics","authors":"modelRxiv","type":"education","description":"","framework":"js","model_id":"Fkcjdo"},{"lastUpdated":1648541570089,"title":"Two-timescale model: Disease transmission and introgression can explain the long-lasting contact zone of modern humans and Neanderthals","authors":"Greenbaum G, Getz WM, Rosenberg NA, Feldman MW, Hovers E, Kolodny O","type":"published","description":"Neanderthals and modern humans both occupied the Levant for tens of thousands of years prior to the spread of modern humans into the rest of Eurasia and their replacement of the Neanderthals.

Recently Gantz and Bier showed that the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology could provide an artificial drive mechanism, the so-called mutagenic chain reaction (MCR), which could lead to rapid fixation of even a deleterious introduced allele. We establish the near equivalence of this system to other gene drive models and review the results of simple models showing that, when there is a fitness cost to the MCR allele, an internal equilibrium may exist that is usually unstable. In this case, introductions must be at a frequency above this critical point for the successful invasion of the MCR allele. We obtain estimates of fixation and invasion probabilities for the appropriate scenarios. Finally, we discuss how polymorphism in natural populations may introduce sources of natural resistance to MCR invasion. These modeling results have important implications for application of MCR in natural populations.","framework":"js","model_id":"T7lcvd"},{"lastUpdated":1705671455168,"title":"Toward a unified theory of microbially mediated invasion","authors":"The authors","type":"preprint","description":"","framework":"py","model_id":"YfndNX"},{"lastUpdated":1651400005417,"title":"Genetic drift with selection and migration","authors":"modelRxiv","type":"education","description":"","framework":"js","model_id":"aGVeKE"},{"lastUpdated":1645030834131,"title":"Designing gene drives to limit spillover to non-target populations","authors":"Greenbaum G, Feldman MW, Rosenberg NA, Kim J","type":"published","description":"The prospect of utilizing CRISPR-based gene-drive technology for controlling populations has generated much excitement. However, the potential for spillovers of gene-drive alleles from the target population to non-target populations has raised concerns. Here, using mathematical models, we investigate the possibility of limiting spillovers to non-target populations by designing differential-targeting gene drives, in which the expected equilibrium gene-drive allele frequencies are high in the target population but low in the non-target population. We find that achieving differential targeting is possible with certain configurations of gene-drive parameters, but, in most cases, only under relatively low migration rates between populations. Under high migration, differential targeting is possible only in a narrow region of the parameter space. Because fixation of the gene drive in the non-target population could severely disrupt ecosystems, we outline possible ways to avoid this outcome. We apply our model to two potential applications of gene drives—field trials for malaria-vector gene drives and control of invasive species on islands. We discuss theoretical predictions of key requirements for differential targeting and their practical implications.","framework":"js","model_id":"d2yQ3C"},{"lastUpdated":1648540983519,"title":"Disease transmission and introgression can explain the long-lasting contact zone of modern humans and Neanderthals","authors":"Greenbaum G, Getz WM, Rosenberg NA, Feldman MW, Hovers E, Kolodny O","type":"published","description":"Neanderthals and modern humans both occupied the Levant for tens of thousands of years prior to the spread of modern humans into the rest of Eurasia and their replacement of the Neanderthals.
