{"lastUpdated":1645030834131,"title":"Designing gene drives to limit spillover to non-target populations","authors":"Greenbaum G, Feldman MW, Rosenberg NA, Kim J","type":"published","date":"2021 Feb","doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1009278","keywords":"","description":"The prospect of utilizing CRISPR-based gene-drive technology for controlling populations has generated much excitement. However, the potential for spillovers of gene-drive alleles from the target population to non-target populations has raised concerns. Here, using mathematical models, we investigate the possibility of limiting spillovers to non-target populations by designing differential-targeting gene drives, in which the expected equilibrium gene-drive allele frequencies are high in the target population but low in the non-target population. We find that achieving differential targeting is possible with certain configurations of gene-drive parameters, but, in most cases, only under relatively low migration rates between populations. Under high migration, differential targeting is possible only in a narrow region of the parameter space. Because fixation of the gene drive in the non-target population could severely disrupt ecosystems, we outline possible ways to avoid this outcome. We apply our model to two potential applications of gene drivesâ€”field trials for malaria-vector gene drives and control of invasive species on islands. We discuss theoretical predictions of key requirements for differential targeting and their practical implications.","framework":"js","pseudocode":"## Defaults\ns = 0.6\nc = 0.8\nh = 0.5\nq1 = 0.5\nq2 = 0\nm = 0.01\n\n## Selection coefficients for heterozygotes\nsn = 0.5 * (1 - c) * (1 - h * s)\nsc = c * (1 - s)\n\n## Migration\nqm1 = q1 * (1 - m) + q2 * m\nqm2 = q2 * (1 - m) + q1 * m\n\n## Average fitness\nw1 = qm1**2 * (1 - s) + 2 * qm1 * (1 - qm1) * (2 * sn + sc) + (1 - qm1)**2\nw2 = qm2**2 * (1 - s) + 2 * qm2 * (1 - qm2) * (2 * sn + sc) + (1 - qm2)**2\n\n## Selection\nq1 = (qm1**2 * (1 - s) + 2 * qm1 * (1 - qm1) * (sn + sc)) / w1\nq2 = (qm2**2 * (1 - s) + 2 * qm2 * (1 - qm2) * (sn + sc)) / w2\n\nreturn q1, q2","code":"","presets":"# Spillover dynamics\ns=0.2\nc=0.8\nh=0.5\n\n# Failure dynamics\ns=0.8\nc=0.8\nh=0.5\n\n# DTE dynamics\ns=0.6\nc=0.8\nh=0.5\nq1=0.6\nq2=0\n\n# Fig. 2, m < m*\ns=0.6\nc=0.8\nh=0\nm=0.01\nq1=[0,1]\nq2=[0,1]\n\n# Fig. 2, m > m*\ns=0.6\nc=0.8\nh=0\nm=0.03\nq1=[0,1]\nq2=[0,1]","input_params":[{"label":"Steps","name":"target_steps","type":"cont","description":"","default_value":"100","range":""},{"label":"s","name":"s","type":"cont","description":"","default_value":"0.6","range":""},{"label":"c","name":"c","type":"cont","description":"","default_value":"0.8","range":""},{"label":"h","name":"h","type":"cont","description":"","default_value":"0.5","range":""},{"label":"q_1","name":"q1","type":"cont","description":"","default_value":"0.5","range":""},{"label":"q_2","name":"q2","type":"cont","description":"","default_value":"0","range":""},{"label":"m","name":"m","type":"cont","description":"","default_value":"0.01","range":""}],"dynamics_params":[{"label":"Population 1","name":"q1","units":"Gene drive frequency","type":"cont","range":""},{"label":"Population 2","name":"q2","units":"Gene drive frequency","type":"cont","range":""}],"result_params":[{"label":"Outcome","name":"outcome","units":"outcome","type":"disc","range":"","values":[{"name":"failure","value":"2","color":"158, 180, 211"},{"name":"spillover","value":"1","color":"255, 102, 102"},{"name":"dte1","value":"3","color":"255, 217, 102"},{"name":"dte2","value":"0","color":"188, 208, 132"}]}],"model_id":"d2yQ3C"}
